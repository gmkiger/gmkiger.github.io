abstract: "How does the provision of public goods by foreign corporations shape electoral engagement? While voters often rely on public goods as indicators of incumbent quality, foreign corporate actors can shape the responsiveness of politicians and the ability of voters to hold them accountable. When corporations, rather than the state, provide public goods, traditional forms of democratic accountability weaken, prompting politicians to prioritize foreign corporate interests and leading citizens to turn to alternative mechanisms, like protest or collective action, to hold both political and corporate actors accountable. We examine the multinational corporate provision of public goods in Northern Mozambique, following the discovery of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2006, utilizing a novel collection of concession agreements between the Mozambican government and multinational corporations. We show that, following substantial investments in public infrastructure in areas relevant to LNG extraction, voters were much less likely to vote or campaign, while other non-electoral activities were not affected. This project offers insight into how multinational corporate actors indirectly shape democratic engagement, particularly in developing countries. "

**Abstract.**  
How does the provision of public goods by foreign corporations shape electoral engagement? While voters often rely on public goods as indicators of incumbent quality, foreign corporate actors can shape the responsiveness of politicians and the ability of voters to hold them accountable. When corporations, rather than the state, provide public goods, traditional forms of democratic accountability weaken, prompting politicians to prioritize foreign corporate interests and leading citizens to turn to alternative mechanisms, like protest or collective action, to hold both political and corporate actors accountable. We examine the multinational corporate provision of public goods in Northern Mozambique, following the discovery of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2006, utilizing a novel collection of concession agreements between the Mozambican government and multinational corporations. We show that, following substantial investments in public infrastructure in areas relevant to LNG extraction, voters were much less likely to vote or campaign, while other non-electoral activities were not affected. This project offers insight into how multinational corporate actors indirectly shape democratic engagement, particularly in developing countries.
