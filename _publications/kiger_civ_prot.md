abstract: "This study addresses the potential avenues for civilian protection strategies in Burundi. Recent reports note the prevalence of violence against civilians, who are at further risk with the upcoming 2020 presidential election. Although engaging the state government and international actors is key for mitigating civilian harm, the most practical strategies involve civilian self-protection. Depending on the forms of violence present, and the level of social cohesion among communities, civilians should either pursue a strategy of neutrality or flight."

**Abstract.**  
This study addresses the potential avenues for civilian protection strategies in Burundi. Recent reports note the prevalence of violence against civilians, who are at further risk with the upcoming 2020 presidential election. Although engaging the state government and international actors is key for mitigating civilian harm, the most practical strategies involve civilian self-protection. Depending on the forms of violence present, and the level of social cohesion among communities, civilians should either pursue a strategy of neutrality or flight.
