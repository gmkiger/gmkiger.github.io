abstract: "Why do political parties use violence against voters before elections? Beyond suppressing turnout among opposition supporters, pre-electoral violence can coerce participation in favor of the perpetrating party. It does so through two reinforcing mechanisms: 1) it signals the party’s willingness and capacity to use further violence in response to unfavorable electoral outcomes, and 2) by depressing turnout in groups for which electoral results are available, it increases the importance of each remaining vote in determining whether such future punishments will occur. We formalize this logic in an incomplete information model in which voters are uncertain about parties' violent capabilities. The model rationalizes why violence is prevalent where voting occurs along ethnic lines; it describes how the granularity of electoral result reporting affects pre- and post-electoral violence, and explains why pre-electoral violence occurs even in areas that largely support the perpetrating party."

**Abstract.**  
Why do political parties use violence against voters before elections? Beyond suppressing turnout among opposition supporters, pre-electoral violence can coerce participation in favor of the perpetrating party. It does so through two reinforcing mechanisms: 1) it signals the party’s willingness and capacity to use further violence in response to unfavorable electoral outcomes, and 2) by depressing turnout in groups for which electoral results are available, it increases the importance of each remaining vote in determining whether such future punishments will occur. We formalize this logic in an incomplete information model in which voters are uncertain about parties' violent capabilities. The model rationalizes why violence is prevalent where voting occurs along ethnic lines; it describes how the granularity of electoral result reporting affects pre- and post-electoral violence, and explains why pre-electoral violence occurs even in areas that largely support the perpetrating party.
