I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Emory University, specializing in political economy, conflict and violence, and quantitative methods. My research examines how political and economic incentives shape violence, governance, and political behavior, with a particular focus on developing and post-conflict contexts.


My work combines formal theory, causal inference, and large-scale observational data, drawing on administrative records, original data collection, and remote sensing. Substantively, I study political violence, civilian victimization, electoral incentives, disaster relief, and the political consequences of resource flows and external actors. My dissertation brings together these themes to examine how institutions and incentives shape both violence and accountability.

<!-- I am on the academic job market in 2026. -->

Before coming to Emory, I earned an MA in International Studies from the [Josef Korbel School of International Studies](https://korbel.du.edu/) at the University of Denver, and a BA in Political Science and International Relations from [William Jewell College](https://www.jewell.edu/programs/political-science). At William Jewell, I also played collegiate soccer.

Prior to graduate school, I worked for several years as a data analyst at the [U.S. Center for SafeSport](https://uscenterforsafesport.org/), where I supported investigations and compliance efforts through applied statistical analysis and data management. That experience continues to inform my interest in applied research and policy-relevant questions.

Outside of academia, I am a long-time Liverpool FC supporter and spend as much time as possible in the mountains—camping, hiking, climbing, and snowboarding whenever I can.
